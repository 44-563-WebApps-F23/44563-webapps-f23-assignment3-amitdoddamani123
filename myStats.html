        <h4>Introdcution about myself:</h4>
        <p>I was born and grew up in India, in a small farm village that is major producer of cotton. So, most of the time I spent was in fields, looking after and helping my family in fields. It helped me to understand the techniques, discipline and the importance of crops and cultivating them.
This embedded me to join agriculture in my high school and then graduate with the diploma in agriculture sciences.  </p>

<h4>Favourite food:</h4>
<p> My favourite food is sambar made by my mom. During my childhood i use to eat regularly. It tastes too good. Now whenever i eat this recepie anywhere i use to remember all those childhood memories.
    The process of making it, it really complex, it involves anything from boiling vegetables to adding just the right amount of spices for a good taste.
    It is better to have it with rice, but some people also have it with chapati and other items.
