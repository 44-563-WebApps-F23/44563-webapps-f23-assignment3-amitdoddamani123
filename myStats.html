        <h4>Introdcution about myself:</h4>
        <p>I was born and grew up in India, in a small farm village that is major producer of cotton. So, most of the time I spent was in fields, looking after and helping my family in fields. It helped me to understand the techniques, discipline and the importance of crops and cultivating them.
This embedded me to join agriculture in my high school and then graduate with the diploma in agriculture sciences.  </p>
